In this paper, we presented a model of gaze shifts that can be applied to a range of characters and provides considerable parametric control. Our model extends a state-of-the-art model of human gaze shifts that achieves the subtle effects seen in natural motions. Our extensions provide significant control over eye geometry and dynamics and allow for view-dependent, performative effects. While the model departs from accurately representing human biological motion, our evaluation confirms that gaze shifts generated by our model are no less accurate or natural than those generated by the baseline model.

The gaze model presented in this paper does not incorporate torso movements, which are simulated in some prior models such as those proposed by Heck \cite{heck2007automated} and Grillon and Thalmann \cite{grillon2009crowds}. Moreover, we have not yet explored how our extensions might be applied to other gaze models, although we believe these extensions to be feasible; techniques that modify target pose such as cross-eyedness removal and performative gaze are applicable to any gaze model, as they only require explicit specification of the gaze target. Techniques for gaze dynamics require only the ability to scale the rotational velocity of the eye joints, which is a simple modification in most models.

Our work has also not considered how the parametric model can be used to create high-level effects in real-world applications. For example, Andrist et al. \cite{andrist2012headeye} showed how gaze parameters can be manipulated to improve learning outcomes in an online lecture scenario. We expect that the ability to use stylized, and even non-human, characters will open up further opportunities. Future exploration in this space must also consider communicative cues beyond the gaze shifts explored in this paper. In future work, we plan to continue our exploration of how we can create mechanisms that control aspects of communication for a wide range of characters.
